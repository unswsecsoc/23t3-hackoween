While enjoying your time at a halloween party, you get a message from an unknown number - warning you that there is a **live bomb** under the house! After rushing to the location, you find a huge tangled mess of wires connected to a huge array of explosive charges. The number messages again, telling you that the defusal code is hidden somewhere in the bomb itself! The message also kindly mentions that there is no time limit, but you were really enjoying that party, so you need to get back to it ASAP!
